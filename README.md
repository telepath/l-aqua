# Printing Base
This is the basic layout of a repo using [openscad-slicer-makefile](https://github.com/telepath/openscad-slicer-makefile).

Clone this to start a new repository, so you can pull configuration updates from this repo to any derived project.

You can also use this to print non-committed files, by copying or symlinking a file into this directory.

# ToDo
Update this file after cloning it into a new repo.
